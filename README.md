# Running out of life

**Running out of life** is a puzzle-action game set in a futuristic world where your character's life depends on a pacemaker-like device — and the battery is nearly depleted. You must navigate through a grid of rooms to reach the backup battery... before time runs out.

## 🧠 Concept

- The game takes place on a 4x4 grid of rooms.
- Before moving, the player can rotate rooms to create an optimal path to the goal.
- Each room has 2–4 doors, each with a different effect:
  - 🔴 **Red door**: Inverts your controls
  - 🟢 **Green door**: Slows your movement but also slows the passage of time
  - 🔵 **Blue door**: Speeds up movement but also drains time faster

The core challenge is planning your route before you start moving, balancing time, speed, and control disruption.

## 🎯 Goal

Reach the room with the battery as efficiently as possible by carefully planning your path and managing time-affecting door mechanics.

## 🌀 Time and Space Manipulation

PulseRun explores the theme of **time and space manipulation**:
- **Space** is manipulated by rotating and aligning rooms before the run.
- **Time** is manipulated through strategic use of different door types that alter both movement and the remaining time.

## 🎮 Gameplay Features

- 4x4 puzzle map with randomized or hand-crafted room configurations
- Pre-run planning phase with room rotation
- Real-time execution phase with time pressure
- Visual and audio feedback for time and control changes

## 🚀 Future Development

- 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 **Multiplayer mode** with competitive timed runs and a global leaderboard
- 🧠 **Advanced player feedback systems** based on psychological perception of time
- 🧩 **Level editor** so players can create and share custom challenges

- Engine: Unity
- Language: C#
- Platform: PC (WebGL/Windows builds planned)
